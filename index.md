Hey, my name is Sergi. Here are some games and random programs I've made in my free time.

## Games

Perform operations by swiftly carrying out the correct actions in the correct order. Beware, if one of the pain, infection, or blood loss gauges reaches 100%, the patient dies, and it's back to square one. There are 3 levels of increasing difficulty; good luck!

Look at the hints; they will help you!

### Left Right (WIP)

Tap left and right to collect coins and avoid obstacles.

Please note this game is a work in progress and has several issues at the moment.

Go to the shop and to some toilet paper, but don't get too close to anyone!

Unfortunately, this game is not available on the Google Play Store as it references COVID. However, you can install it in only a few extra taps if you follow the instructions in its Itch.io page below.

## Other programs

### Maze Solver

Create a maze (or just use a random one) and watch as the computer solves it at breakneck speed!

Java Version 8 or above required.

### Dragon Curve Drawer

Watch the computer draw a beautiful [Dragon Curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_curve).

### Battleships AI

Play Battleships against my algorithm!

A lightweight app for playing Battleships when you have no friends to play with :-(. Note that the app does not include a way to record what locations you have fired at â€“ you'll need pen and paper for that.
